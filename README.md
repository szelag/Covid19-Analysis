# Covid19-Analysis
Some tools just for fun, looking at Covid19 data as a personal project

## Background
The intent of this toolset is to have a variety of utilities for automatic data processing as opposed to manual data entry from any of the websites floating around out there.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to look at any of this yourself, you will need the following:
1.	The data provided from John's Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
2.	Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (free from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Future Work & Contribution
There's an issues list I'm intermittently adding things to as I find them. Feel free to add to that, or if you'd like to submit some code - let me know.
